# Gemini API Key Setup Instructions

Add the following line to your `.env` file:

```
GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyAg05zcv9R69ZYEQSFEsSHdS-RwyQ6jXKs
```

This will enable the image analysis feature for product uploads.

## Security Note
- Keep your API keys confidential
- The `.env` file is correctly excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
- Never commit API keys to your repository

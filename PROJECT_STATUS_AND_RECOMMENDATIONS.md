### 2. Enhancement Features

**Phase 1: Core Platform Development**

*   **1.1 Project Setup and Environment Configuration**: [Complete - Pending UI Testing] - Basic project structure is in place with `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, and various configuration files. Git repository is assumed to be set up. Environment variables and coding standards are likely in place but need verification.
*   **1.2 Database Design and Schema Implementation**: [In Progress] - `prisma/schema.prisma` suggests database setup using Prisma. Tables for `categories` and `products` are likely defined, but `styles` table and modifications to `products` table (variants, quantity_in_stock) need to be verified against the schema.
*   **1.3 Business Customer Management**: [In Progress] - Files like `src/components/business/BusinessVerification.tsx`, `src/api/businessVerification.ts`, and `src/server/routes/businessVerification.ts` indicate work on business customer registration and verification. Document upload and form validation are likely implemented, but the full workflow (review, status updates, notifications) needs verification. Business profile management form (`src/components/business/BusinessVerification.tsx`) seems to be in place.
*   **1.4 E-commerce Features**: [Not Started] - No specific files or code structures clearly indicate implementation of wholesale pricing tiers, MOQ enforcement, retail website cross-linking, wholesale pricing calculator, or bulk order management.
*   **1.5 Product Management**: [In Progress] - `src/components/admin/products` directory contains components for product management (`ProductForm.tsx`, `ProductList.tsx`, `EditProduct.tsx`). Category-based product organization is likely in place. Bulk product upload, inventory tracking, variant management, wholesale descriptions, and availability status need to be verified.
*   **1.6 Order Processing**: [Not Started] - No specific files or code structures suggest implementation of bulk order processing, business credit application, payment terms, shipping calculation, order tracking, automated invoicing, or return/refund management.

**Phase 2: Admin Portal Development**

*   **2.1 AI-Powered Inventory Management**: [In Progress] - `src/server/services/imageAnalysisService.ts` indicates that AI image analysis for product categorization is implemented using the Gemini API.
*   **2.2 Smart Product Cataloging**: [In Progress] -  AI-driven product categorization is partially implemented through `src/server/services/imageAnalysisService.ts`, but the product approval workflow is not yet implemented.
*   **2.3 Mobile/Tablet Integration**: [Not Started] - No specific code or structural elements suggest mobile/tablet admin interface features.
*   **2.4 Business Intelligence Dashboard**: [Not Started] - No code related to customer, inventory, or sales analytics dashboards is apparent.
*   **2.5 AI-Powered Product Management**: [Not Started] - No code related to automated workflows for image processing, description generation, category suggestions, pricing recommendations, or SEO optimization is apparent.

**Phase 3: AI Integration** and **Phase 4: Advanced Features** are marked as **[Not Started]** based on the codebase review.

## Recommendations and Suggestions

1.  **Admin Login Page Design Parity**:
    *   The admin login page should have a similar look and feel to the customer login modal (`src/components/auth/AuthModal.tsx`) for design consistency.
    *   Consider creating a reusable `AuthLayout` component that can be used for both customer and admin authentication pages to maintain a unified UI.

2.  **Admin User Creation**:
    *   Implement a user management section in the admin portal to create and manage admin users.
    *   This would involve:
        *   A new page in the admin panel (e.g., "Admin Users" under "Settings").
        *   Form for creating new admin users (email, password, role).
        *   API endpoints to handle admin user creation, listing, editing, and deletion.
        *   Database schema update to store admin user information (if not already present).
    *   For enhanced security, passwords should be hashed before storing in the database.

3.  **Supplier Information and Super Admin**:
    *   Adding supplier information is a valuable feature for inventory and product management.
    *   Database Schema Changes:
        *   Create a `suppliers` table with fields for `name`, `address`, `phone`, `email`, etc.
        *   Add a `supplier_id` foreign key to the `products` table to link products to suppliers.
        *   Include `supplier_cost` and `initial_purchase_quantity` in the `products` table or a related table (e.g., `product_inventory`).
    *   Admin Panel UI:
        *   Create a "Suppliers" section in the admin panel to manage supplier information (Create, Read, Update, Delete - CRUD operations).
        *   In the "Products" section, add fields to associate products with suppliers and input supplier cost and initial quantity.
    *   Super Admin Role:
        *   Introduce a "superadmin" role in addition to the "admin" role.
        *   Super admins would have access to supplier information and potentially other sensitive settings, while regular admins might have restricted access.
        *   Role-based access control (RBAC) should be implemented to enforce these permissions.

4.  **Additional Standard E-commerce Features**:
    *   **Roles and Permissions Management**:  Expand beyond "admin" and "superadmin" to include more granular roles (e.g., "inventory manager," "sales manager") with specific permissions.
    *   **Detailed Reporting and Analytics**: Implement more comprehensive reports on sales, inventory, customer behavior, and marketing performance.
    *   **Content Management System (CMS)**:  Consider a basic CMS for managing static content pages like "About Us," "Contact Us," "Terms of Service," etc.
    *   **Marketing Tools**:  Basic marketing features could include discount code creation, promotional banners, and integration with email marketing services.
    *   **Customer Support Tools**:  Integration with a customer support platform or a basic ticketing system within the admin panel can improve customer service.
    *   **Tax and Payment Configuration**:  Robust settings for tax calculation and configuration of various payment gateways are essential for a functional e-commerce platform.
    *   **SEO Optimization Tools**:  Beyond smart tagging, consider tools for managing meta descriptions, URL structures, and sitemaps.

5.  **Product Approval Workflow**:
    *   The product approval workflow is likely **not yet implemented**.
    *   To implement the product approval workflow, we need to consider the following:

        1.  **Database Schema Update**: Add a `status` field to the `products` table to track the product's approval status (e.g., "Draft," "Pending Review," "Approved," "Published," "Archived").

        2.  **Backend API Implementation**:
            *   Modify the product creation and update API endpoints (`POST /api/products`, `PUT /api/products/:productId`) to handle setting the initial product status (likely "Draft" upon creation).
            *   Create new API endpoints for:
                *   Fetching products based on status (e.g., `/api/admin/products?status=pending_review`).
                *   Updating product status (e.g., `PUT /api/admin/products/:productId/status`).

        3.  **Admin Portal UI Updates**:
            *   **Product List Page (`src/components/admin/products/ProductList.tsx`):**
                *   Display product status in the product list table.
                *   Add filters to view products by status (e.g., "Draft," "Pending Review," "Approved").
            *   **Product Form Page (`src/components/admin/products/ProductForm.tsx`):**
                *   Potentially add a status dropdown or UI element to view/set the product status (though status transitions might be handled elsewhere, like in the product list).
            *   **New "Product Review" Page (or Modal):**
                *   Create a dedicated page (or modal) for reviewing products in "Pending Review" status.
                *   This page would display product details and allow admins to approve or reject products, updating their status accordingly.

        4.  **State Management Updates (`src/stores/productStore.ts`):**
            *   Update state and actions to handle product status.
            *   Modify `createProduct`, `updateProduct` actions to work with the new status field and API endpoints.
            *   Add actions for fetching products by status and updating product status.
